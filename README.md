# We have developed a spatiotemporal methodology to delineate boundaries for Extreme Heat and Cold Events across space and time.

In an exploratory work, we have compiled climatological data from year 2010 to 2020 from California to interpolate the geostatistical distribution of average daily apparent temperature for more than 120 NOAA stations using an Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) technique.
