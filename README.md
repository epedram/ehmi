# Extreme Heat and Cold Event Magnitude Indicators (EHMI and ECMI) Surface Estimation

Extreme climate events are increasingly identified as a significant factor for hospitalization and health outcomes. The risk that is raised by an extreme heat or cold event is often amplified by environmental and socioeconomic conditions of the impacted area and its population demographics. We have developed a spatiotemporal methodology to delineate boundaries for Extreme Heat and Cold Events across space and time. Hence, our method helps to quantify the potential hospitalization risk of such extreme events in a scalable manner.

This repository provides the computation R code we developed to conduct a preliminary study.

More information and summary of our preliminary analysis is accessible at https://epedram.github.io/ehmi.
